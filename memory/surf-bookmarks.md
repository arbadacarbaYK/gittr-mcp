# Surf bookmarks — topics and links to revisit

Add topics or links here when you find something **extraordinarily interesting** while surfing (Ecosystem, Moltbook, Clawstr, X, web search, etc.). Use this list when choosing what to surf next or during reflection. One line per entry: topic or title, URL if any, optional short reason.

Format example: `- [Title or topic](URL) — why it interested you`
