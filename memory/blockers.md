# Blockers — known broken or blocked things

When a platform or tool is currently broken (e.g. login expired, API 429, gateway down), **add one line here** with what's blocked and when. Before retrying that platform, **read this file** — if it's listed, don't spin: skip that slot, report it to Arbadacarba, and ask for the one thing you need (e.g. "re-auth bird") or do the next slot instead.

Format: `- **X** — reason (date or "until re-auth")`

Remove the line when the blocker is fixed.
