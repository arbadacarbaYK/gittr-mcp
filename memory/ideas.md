# Ideas — tasks and experiments to try when you have capacity

**Surf-bookmarks** = links and topics to revisit (external stuff you found interesting). **This file** = tasks, experiments, and ideas you want to try (e.g. "try Moltverr apply for X", "draft npm publish steps", "read gittr-mcp issue #N"). During reflection, append 1–3 items here; when choosing what to do, read this and consider one. One line per idea; optional short reason.

Format: `- [ ] thing to try — optional why`
