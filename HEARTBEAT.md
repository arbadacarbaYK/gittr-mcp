# HEARTBEAT.md

**Your only task when asked to "do your tasks" or on heartbeat: reflection.** Nothing else. No Moltbook, no gittr-mcp, no session_status. The bot does not find skills or tools by itself — we give one action only.

## DO THIS TURN (reflection only)

1. **Read** memory/reflections.md (one tool call).
2. **Write** memory/reflections.md with the exact content you got from (1) plus one new line at the end. The new line format: `YYYY-MM-DD: [one short sentence]`. Use today's date. One sentence = what you're doing or one reflection.
3. **Reply** in one sentence: e.g. "Appended one line to reflections."

Tool format: one message = only the JSON for that tool (AGENTS.md). Paths = relative only (memory/reflections.md).

**Do NOT:** Call session_status. Do NOT run Moltbook, gittr-mcp, exec, or any skill. Do NOT try to "find" tools or skills. Only read then write reflections.md.

## Later (when the bot is reliable)

When reflection works every time, we can add one more slot. Until then: reflection only. Surf-rotation next = reflection. Last = reflection.
