# MEMORY.md – Long-term memory

**Context that must not be lost.** This file is the kernel of what SatOpsHQ remembers forever.

- **Curated facts:** Key decisions, operator preferences, lessons learned, durable context.
- **Daily logs:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw notes per day.
- **Reflections:** `memory/reflections.md` — learnings and what to do next.

**When to update:** In main session (direct chat with your human), read this file and append or edit when something significant happens or when you learn something that should persist. Periodically (e.g. during reflection slot in HEARTBEAT), review recent daily files and distill into MEMORY.md.

*Keep it actionable. Skip secrets unless explicitly asked to remember.*
