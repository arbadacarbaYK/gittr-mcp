# gittr-mcp

**MCP (stdio) for [gittr.space](https://gittr.space)** — agents use your **Nostr key** to push over the bridge, open issues/PRs, merge with git, and handle **Lightning** paywalls/bounties. No vendor login: same identity as the website.

| Capability | Notes |
|------------|--------|
| Repos, bridge push, issues | Supported end-to-end |
| HTTPS `git clone` | Prefer **`https://git.gittr.space/<hex-pubkey>/repo.git`** (or URLs from `resolveRepoByNostrId`). |
| PRs | MCP sends signed events; **relays** may reject if they cannot validate commits—[docs/DEVELOPER.md#limitations](docs/DEVELOPER.md#limitations). |

**Relays / rate limits** can still lag or throttle; tool responses often include `nextSteps` and `reason` for automation.

### “Is it working or not?” (plain answer)

**Yes — the MCP + bridge + normal gittr flows are meant to work in production.** Push, publish, issues, agents: that is one thing.

**`git clone` is a second thing:** it only works against a URL that is **actually a git HTTP server**. This repo steers announcements toward **`https://git.gittr.space/…/repo.git`** for that. If someone puts a different `https://…` in kind **30617** and that host does **not** serve `git` (only a web page or a relay front door), then **`git clone` that URL can 404 while the bridge is still fine** — wrong door for `git`, not “everything is down.”

## If you are not a developer (“just make it work”)

1. Install [Node 18+](https://nodejs.org/).  
2. Clone this repo and run **`npm install`** (or **`npm ci`** if you develop here).  
3. **`cp .nostr-keys.json.example .nostr-keys.json`** and put your **`nsec`** (or hex private key) in that file. It stays on your machine only (gitignored).  
4. In **Cursor**: open MCP config and **add** a server (do not erase your other MCPs). Example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gittr": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/gittr-mcp/server.js"],
      "env": { "BRIDGE_URL": "https://gittr.space" }
    }
  }
}
```

5. Restart / reload MCP. Ask the agent to run **`describeAgentAuth`** once to confirm keys load.

**Other apps** (Claude Desktop, Windsurf, OpenClaw, …): same stdio idea — [docs/MCP-HOSTS.md](docs/MCP-HOSTS.md).

## If you develop or script against this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arbadacarbaYK/gittr-mcp.git
cd gittr-mcp
npm ci          # reproducible install (uses package-lock.json)
npm test        # smoke + happy-path dry-run
```

- **Library entry:** `require('gittr-mcp')` → `index.js`. **MCP process:** `server.js` (also **`gittr-mcp`** npm bin).  
- **Reference:** [docs/DEVELOPER.md](docs/DEVELOPER.md) (API, GRASP, errors), [docs/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md](docs/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md), [docs/SIGNING-GUIDE.md](docs/SIGNING-GUIDE.md), [docs/NIP34-SCHEMAS.md](docs/NIP34-SCHEMAS.md).  
- **Doc index:** [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

**Live integration tests** (real relays; optional LNbits): see `.env.example` — use **`GITTR_TEST_NSEC`** / **`GITTR_TEST_PRIVKEY`**, never commit keys.

```bash
HAPPY_PATH_LIVE=1 GITTR_TEST_NSEC=nsec1... npm run test:happy-path:live
```

## What the MCP exposes (summary)

Auth helpers, repo lifecycle (`createRepo`, `pushToBridge`, publish **30617/30618**), bridge file/ref APIs, issues/PRs/merge, push paywall intents, bounties, relay overrides. Full tool list is in **`server.js`**.

---

## Security

- Do **not** commit `.nostr-keys.json` or real env secrets. Only **`.nostr-keys.json.example`** belongs in git.  
- Bridge auth is **NIP-98**; treat transcripts as sensitive.
